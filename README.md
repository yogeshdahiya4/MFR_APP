# Microsoft-FRT
Project for Microsoft Future Ready Talent Internship.
In this project I built a web application which displays real time prices and market cap of various crypto currencies to users.
My application uses API calls to fetch real time data and displays it across the web.
I have used Azure Static Web Apps to deploy my web application on the web.
I used Visual Studio Code as My Text Editor for developing this Web Application and Azure Blob Storage to hold the static pages for my app.
If the Appliction is not loading you can try switching to a different browser (It works with Google Chrome the best) or try refreshing the page 2-3 times.
